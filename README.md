## ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
This is a python scrypt I made that creates suprisingly good passwords. You enter in a email and it will go through a list of a ton of words and will add numbers to the end and in front randomly. you also have the option of including special charectors and amount of passwords to generate.

## OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
  ```python
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5Orlando
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?539Genesis
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?Oakley
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?53Kaden
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5390Jabari
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Aden5?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Trinity539?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Adaline?
  ```
it creates very realistic looking passwords

## THE SPEED:
    
This is a test taken 5 times, on a linux based machine, with special charectors on, generating 1 million passwords


on average 45k passwords generated a second! (test results = 46112.6409959 passwords/s)

on average it took 23 seconds to generate 1,000,000 passwords! (test results = 21.9234482765 seconds)

## INSTALLATION:
