## DESCRIPTION
This is a python script I made that creates suprisingly legit looking passwords. You enter in a email and it will go through a list of words and will add numbers to the end and in front randomly. you also have the option of including special charectors and amount of passwords to generate.

## OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
  ```python
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5Orlando
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?539Genesis
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?Oakley
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?53Kaden
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5390Jabari
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Aden5?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Trinity539?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Adaline?
  ```
it creates very realistic looking passwords

## THE SPEED:  
This is a test taken 5 times, on a linux based machine, with special charectors on, generating 1 million passwords


- on average 45k passwords generated a second! (test results = 46112.6409959 passwords/s)

- on average it took 23 seconds to generate 1,000,000 passwords! (test results = 21.9234482765 seconds)

## INSTALLATION:
- Go to the little green button that says code, click on it, download the .zip and extract it to get the files.

- Then you want to run .py program found in the extracted folder, here is instructions on how to run it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFYcAOsNyvs

- run in cmd: python "C:/Users/your username/Desktop/Password_Cracker-main/Password_Cracker-main/V4_Password_Cracker.py"

- IMPORTANT (the scrypt will not work without this): to install the libraries to work go to cmd and run 'pip install colorama' without the ''
