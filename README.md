## ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
This is a python scrypt I made that creates suprisingly good passwords. You enter in a email and it will go through a list of a ton of words and will add numbers to the end and in front randomly. you also have the option of including special charectors and amount of passwords to generate.

## OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
  ```python
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5Orlando
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?539Genesis
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?Oakley
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?53Kaden
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:?5390Jabari
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Aden5?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Trinity539?
  HardMineSheep@gmail.com:Adaline?
  ```
it creates very realistic looking passwords
